        <strong> Rules<br /> </strong> Do NOT submit malicious code with
        malicious intent to the grader. Furthermore, do not attempt to exploit
        any aspect of this system, including but not limited to, accessing
        unauthorized admin privileges, accessing private user information, etc.
        If we find out any misuse, you will be disqualified from participating
        in TJCT competitions, events, and also reported to our sponsors.<br />
        Furthermore, please follow all rules given when taking contests on this
        system. Perhaps there will be collaborative contests, but unless
        otherwise stated, contests are individual. All aspects of the TJHSST
        honor code apply.
        <br /><br />
        <% if (!locals.tjioi) { %> In general, please note what you can and
        cannot do for contests. These are subject to change.
        <br />
        1. You ARE allowed to use templates and pre-written datastructures. We
        acknowledge that in-houses are short on time and having pre-written code
        can make the process much less tedious.
        <br />
        2. You ARE allowed to use reference sources online such as language
        specific documentation. General algorithm guides such as GeeksForGeeks
        is allowed if the guide doesn't completely solve the problem.
        <br />
        3. You are NOT allowed consult intelligent/human sources during a
        contest.
        <br />
        4. You are NOT allowed to discuss problem details until the alloted time
        window for the contest is over. <% } %>
